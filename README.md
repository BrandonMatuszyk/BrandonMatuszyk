👋 Hey there!

🚀 Let me introduce myself: I'm Brandon Matuszyk, a passionate Full Stack Engineer Developer, and my specialty is crafting awesome React Applications. My journey into the world of coding began as a self-taught developer, and I fine-tuned my skills further by attending the Sabio Coding Bootcamp. I've had hands-on experience with a diverse tech stack, including ReactJs, Axios, JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Formik, C#, .NET, SQL, and RESTful APIs.

👨‍💻 I'm genuinely enthusiastic about exploring new technologies. It all started in 2020 when I delved into the foundations of JavaScript, and I've been on an exciting learning journey ever since.

🛥️ In a past life, I proudly served as a Boatswain Mate in the U.S. Coast Guard. During my time there, I not only fulfilled search and rescue missions on the east coast but also engaged in drug interdiction efforts in Central America. I've got some incredible stories from those days, and I'm always up for sharing a few.

🎓 On the academic front, I'm also a Catamount from Western Carolina University, where I earned a degree in Communication Sciences and Nutrition and Dietetics. My diverse educational background complements my tech skills perfectly.

🏈 Speaking of passions, I'm a die-hard Green Bay Packers fan! You'll often find me cheering for the green and gold, especially during the NFL season.

🎸 Beyond the world of tech, I thrive on pushing my boundaries and acquiring new skills. You'll often find me hiking, playing disc golf, navigating white water in a kayak, or exploring any outdoor adventure that comes my way. And when I need a break, you'll catch me relieving stress at the gym, especially now that I'm living in the city.

📚 I'm an avid reader, and my interests span personal development and gripping fiction. I even belong to a cigar and book club with a fantastic group of folks, where our reading choices vary each month.

✈️ Traveling is a big passion of mine. I've had the privilege of exploring a wide array of destinations, from SE Asia to the picturesque landscapes of Spain, France, England, Ireland, Andorra, Switzerland, Panama, Costa Rica, and Mexico. I've probably missed a few spots, but there are certainly more adventures on the horizon!

Feel free to connect and join me on this exciting journey through technology, football, and life's adventures. 🌟 Go Pack Go! 🧀🏈
